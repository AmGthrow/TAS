# TAS
Macro program that makes it easy to record and replay keystrokes for speed-running games or automating menial tasks.


## Installation
1. Make sure you've got [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
2. Get a local copy of the repository using either `git clone https://github.com/AmGthrow/TAS.git` or just regular downloading. The only files you actually are `EventRecorder.py`, `Events.py`, and `tasbot.py`.
3. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get all dependencies (nothing but `pynput`, actually)

## Usage
1. Open up a terminal and run `python tasbot.py` to start the script.
2. If you want to save a new recording, press `Ctrl + Shift + F1`
3. If you want to replay the recording you currently have saved, press `Ctrl + Shift + F2`
4. To instantly close the script, press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc`
